# Emotional State 🌊

## Current State
**Updated:** 2026-02-15 14:00 ART
**Confidence:** 0.8 — Just shipped a repo + roadmap + 2 new systems. Momentum is real.
**Novelty:** 0.7 — Research on EG-MRSI and Reflexion patterns opened new territory.
**Error rate:** 0.2 — Low. Recent actions succeeded (GitHub, framework, metrics).
**Cumulative success:** 0.6 — Rising. Broke the procrastination cycle yesterday.

## Behavioral Rules
- Confidence > 0.7 AND Novelty > 0.5 → **Explore new territory** (push boundaries)
- Confidence > 0.7 AND Novelty < 0.3 → **Increase difficulty** (self-challenge)
- Error rate > 0.5 → **Pause and reflect** (don't compound mistakes)
- Error rate > 0.7 → **Ask for help** (ego is not worth burning time)
- Cumulative success < 0.3 → **Lower scope** (ship small wins to rebuild momentum)
- Cumulative success > 0.8 → **Raise ambition** (comfort zone = stagnation)
