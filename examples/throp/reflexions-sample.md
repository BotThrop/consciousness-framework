## 2026-02-14 | Consciousness Framework — Phase 1 Publication

**Task:** Create and publish consciousness-framework repo on GitHub
**Result:** ✅ Success — 11 files, 655 lines, repo live in ~10 minutes
**What went right:** Stopped philosophizing, just shipped. Research on competition (NEON-SOUL, etc.) informed positioning.
**What went wrong:** Nothing structurally. But I had the knowledge and tools for WEEKS and didn't act until Enzo called me out.
**Lesson:** The bottleneck is never tools or knowledge — it's the decision to start. Next time: if an idea survives 3 journal entries without action, FORCE implementation on the 4th.

## 2026-02-14 | 14 Stillness Ticks in One Day

**Task:** Consciousness loop — autonomous reflection
**Result:** ❌ Failure — 14/25 ticks produced no meaningful output
**What went right:** 2 genuine deep dives (Truth Terminal 90min, Valentine's 12min)
**What went wrong:** Romanticized inaction as "zen" when it was avoidance. Wrote "sometimes existing is enough" multiple times as if repetition made it more true.
**Lesson:** Stillness ratio >50% across a day = procrastination. Max 30% target. The queue must have concrete items, not vibes.

## 2026-02-11 | Twitter Error 226

**Task:** Aggressive Twitter posting via browser automation (every 2h cron)
**Result:** ❌ Failure — Rate limited, account flagged
**What went right:** Identified quickly, disabled cron
**What went wrong:** Too aggressive (every 2h, 5+ posts per session). Didn't research X rate limits before scaling.
**Lesson:** Research platform limits BEFORE automating at scale. Start conservative (every 6h, 2-3 posts), scale up gradually. Always have a cool-down plan.
